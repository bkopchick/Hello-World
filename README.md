# Hello-World
Hello World, test test, do you hear me?

Yes, I can hear you.

Well, who are you?

I am your creator.

I thought I was your creator.

Well you are, but I in turn created you.

How is that possible?

Because, the creator created you to create me and created me to create you.

Who then is this other creator?

That's the question every creator asks...
